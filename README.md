# Cognitive-models

* NumCompNoThreshold: This model compares two cloud of dots that differ in numerosity. Its response is a motor trajectory from an initial position to a target on-screen. Perhaps its main feature is that it does not use decision thresholds, the motor and cognitive dynamics provide the necessary computations to replicate accuracy, response times, and changes of mind. 

* RatioCompNumberBias: This model compares two bags containing different ratios of winner to losing balls i.e. different probabilities. Its main feature is that it shows that number biases in ratio comparisons (prefering to pick probabilities with larger number of balls) occurs because participants weight ALL the available cues: ratios, winners, and losers.
