# Cognitive-models

* NumCompNoThreshold: This model compares two cloud of dots that differ in numerosity. Its response is a motor trajectory from an initial position to a target on-screen. Perhaps its main feature is that it does not use decision thresholds, the motor and cognitive dynamics provide the necessary computations to replicate accuracy, response times, and changes of mind. 

* RatioCompNumberBias: This model compares two bags containing different ratios of winner to losing balls i.e. different probabilities. Its main feature is that it replicates number biases in ratio comparisons (prefering to pick probabilities with larger number of balls) by weighting ALL the available cues: ratios, winners, and losers. This model instantiates the hypothesis that humans have an intrinsic number bias above and beyond the ability to compute ratios.
